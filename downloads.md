# Downloads

ND4j lets you switch between three computational backends: one for GPUs and two different native blas bindings. 

In Maven, it's fairly easy to switch between different backends. Without Maven, it may be harder. Here we provide a number of archives that contain all of the jar files required to use ND4J's backends.
